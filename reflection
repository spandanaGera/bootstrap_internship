# Project Reflection

This project helped me understand how to design clean, responsive layouts using **Bootstrap 5**. I explored the documentation, selected suitable components, and combined them to create three polished pages.

## 📘 What I Did
- Studied Bootstrap examples (navbar, cards, hero, forms)
- Designed Home, About, and Contact pages using components
- Ensured consistent spacing and responsiveness
- Hosted the project on GitHub Pages
- Prepared README and reflection as required

## 🧩 Tools Used
Bootstrap 5, HTML, CSS, VS Code, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and minimal AI assistance (for layout ideas & improvements).

## ⚙️ Challenges
- Maintaining uniform spacing → solved using Bootstrap utilities  
- Making pages responsive → used grid system & breakpoints  
- GitHub Pages deployment → fixed by setting branch = main, folder = root  

## ✅ Summary
This internship task strengthened my Bootstrap skills, improved my UI design approach, and helped me learn proper project structuring and hosting.
